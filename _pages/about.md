<span style="font-size:6em;">Hello,</span>

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Iâ€™m Krass and I am a software engineer ðŸ˜Š.</span> 



<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> I currently work with Swift and Objective-C on iOS and macOS with a focus on cybersecurity.

  My interests also include broader topics like Machine Learning, Physics, and Neuroscience. In my free time I like writing and making videos about the things I learn. You can find them on this blog and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMxuZP6KUb_i9F-K1LAtrw){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
